# What is CSS?

**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**.  
- **Cascading:** Refers to the way styles are applied based on hierarchy and specificity.
- **Style Sheets:** Files or blocks of code that define how elements on your webpage should look.

**Key Point:** CSS is not a programming language. It’s a styling language used to describe the presentation (layout, colors, fonts, etc.) of a web page written in HTML.

# Why Use CSS?

HTML structures your content, but CSS makes it look good. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), you can:
- Keep your code clean and organized.
- Change the look of your entire site by editing just one CSS file.
- Create responsive designs that work on various devices.

# How to Add CSS to an HTML Document

There are three main ways to include CSS in your HTML:

1. **Inline CSS:**  
   Add styles directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute.
   ```html
   <p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is a styled paragraph.</p>
   ```

2. **Internal CSS:**  
   Include CSS inside a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML document.
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>My Web Page</title>
       <style>
         body {
           background-color: #f0f0f0;
         }
         h1 {
           color: darkblue;
         }
       </style>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Welcome!</h1>
       <p>This page has internal CSS.</p>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **External CSS:**  
   Link to an external CSS file using the `<link>` tag. This is the most common and efficient method.
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>My Web Page</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Welcome!</h1>
       <p>This page uses external CSS.</p>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```
   In `styles.css`:
   ```css
   body {
     background-color: #f0f0f0;
   }
   h1 {
     color: darkblue;
   }
   ```

# CSS Syntax and Structure

A CSS rule is made up of a **selector** and a **declaration block**.

### Basic Syntax:
```css
selector {
  property: value;
  /* More properties can be added here */
}
```

- **Selector:** Identifies which HTML element(s) the rule applies to.
- **Declaration Block:** Contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
- **Property:** A style attribute (e.g., `color`, `font-size`).
- **Value:** The setting for the property (e.g., `blue`, `16px`).

### Example:
```css
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```
This rule changes all `<p>` elements to have red text with a font size of 16 pixels.

# Selectors: Targeting HTML Elements

CSS selectors let you choose which HTML elements to style. Here are some common selectors:

1. **Type Selector:**  
   Selects all elements of a given type.
   ```css
   h1 {
     font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
   }
   ```

2. **Class Selector:**  
   Selects elements with a specific class. Use a dot (`.`) before the class name.
   ```css
   .highlight {
     background-color: yellow;
   }
   ```
   HTML example:
   ```html
   <p class="highlight">This text is highlighted.</p>
   ```

3. **ID Selector:**  
   Selects a single element with a unique ID. Use a hash (`#`) before the ID name.
   ```css
   #main-title {
     font-size: 2em;
   }
   ```
   HTML example:
   ```html
   <h1 id="main-title">This is the main title.</h1>
   ```

4. **Descendant Selector:**  
   Selects elements that are inside another element.
   ```css
   .container p {
     color: green;
   }
   ```
   HTML example:
   ```html
   <div class="container">
     <p>This paragraph is green.</p>
   </div>
   ```

5. **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements:**  
   These selectors target elements in a specific state or part of an element.
   - **Pseudo-class example:** `a:hover` styles links when hovered over.
     ```css
     a:hover {
       color: red;
     }
     ```
   - **Pseudo-element example:** `p::first-line` styles the first line of a paragraph.
     ```css
     p::first-line {
       font-weight: bold;
     }
     ```

---

# The Cascade and Specificity

CSS stands for **Cascading** Style Sheets. The cascade determines which style rules apply if more than one rule targets the same element. Two key factors are:

1. **Specificity:**  
   A system that ranks rules based on how specifically they target an element. For example:
   - An ID selector (`#id`) is more specific than a class selector (`.class`).
   - A class selector is more specific than a type selector (e.g., `p`).

2. **Source Order:**  
   If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the CSS is applied.

**Example:**
```css
/* Rule 1 */
p {
  color: blue;
}

/* Rule 2 */
.highlight {
  color: red;
}
```
If you have:
```html
<p class="highlight">Hello World!</p>
```
The text will be red because the class selector has a higher specificity than the type selector.

# The Box Model

Every HTML element is considered a box in CSS. The **box model** consists of:

1. **Content:** The text, image, or other media inside the element.
2. **Padding:** Space between the content and the border.
3. **Border:** A line that surrounds the padding (if any).
4. **Margin:** Space outside the border, separating the element from others.

### Visual Representation:
```
+----------------------------+
|         Margin             |
|  +----------------------+  |
|  |      Border        |  |
|  |  +--------------+  |  |
|  |  |   Padding    |  |  |
|  |  |  +--------+  |  |  |
|  |  |  | Content|  |  |  |
|  |  |  +--------+  |  |  |
|  |  +--------------+  |  |
|  +----------------------+  |
+----------------------------+
```

### Example:
```css
div {
  width: 300px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 10px;
}
```
This CSS rule defines a `div` element with a specific width, padding, border, and margin.

# Layout Techniques

CSS offers several techniques to arrange elements on a page:

## 1. **Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout)**
Flexbox is great for aligning items in one direction (row or column) and for responsive design.

### Example:
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Distributes space evenly */
  align-items: center;            /* Aligns items vertically */
}
```
HTML:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</div>
```

## 2. **CSS Grid**
CSS Grid is ideal for creating complex, two-dimensional layouts.

### Example:
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* Three equal columns */
  gap: 10px;                          /* Space between grid items */
}
```
HTML:
```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div>Grid Item 1</div>
  <div>Grid Item 2</div>
  <div>Grid Item 3</div>
  <div>Grid Item 4</div>
</div>
```

## 3. **Positioning**
CSS positioning lets you control how elements are placed:
- **Static:** Default; elements flow naturally.
- **Relative:** Positioned relative to its normal position.
- **Absolute:** Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
- **Fixed:** Positioned relative to the browser window.
- **Sticky:** Acts like relative until it hits a threshold, then becomes fixed.

### Example:
```css
.relative-box {
  position: relative;
  left: 20px; /* Moves the element 20px to the right */
}
```

---

# Responsive Design with Media Queries

Media queries allow you to apply CSS rules based on the device’s characteristics (such as width, height, or orientation).

### Example:
```css
/* Default styles */
body {
  background-color: white;
}

/* For screens smaller than 600px */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgray;
  }
}
```
This rule changes the background color when the screen width is 600px or less.

---

# CSS Comments

Comments in CSS help you document your code. They are not rendered by browsers.
```css
/* This is a single-line comment */

/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  You can write as much as you need here.
*/
```

---

# CSS Variables (Custom Properties)

CSS variables allow you to store values that you can reuse throughout your stylesheet. They improve maintainability.
```css
:root {
  --main-color: #3498db;
  --padding: 20px;
}

header {
  background-color: var(--main-color);
  padding: var(--padding);
}
```
- **`:root`**: Represents the root element and is a common place to define global variables.
- **`var(--variable-name)`**: Retrieves the value of a variable.

---

# Advanced Topics

## 1. **Transitions and Animations**
CSS transitions allow you to smoothly change property values over time, and animations let you create more complex sequences.

### Transition Example:
```css
button {
  background-color: blue;
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: green;
}
```

### Animation Example:
```css
@keyframes slideIn {
  from {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
}

.element {
  animation: slideIn 1s forwards;
}
```

## 2. **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements Revisited**
- **Pseudo-classes:** Target an element’s state (e.g., `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`).
- **Pseudo-elements:** Target a specific part of an element (e.g., `::before`, `::after`).

### Example:
```css
/* Adding content before an element */
p::before {
  content: "Note: ";
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## 3. **CSS Preprocessors**
Tools like Sass, LESS, or Stylus extend CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins. They require a compilation step to convert them into standard CSS.
